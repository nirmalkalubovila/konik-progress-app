# KONIK Progress Tracker

A discipline-first habit tracker built on the principles of consistency, progress, systems, and discipline.

## Overview

The KONIK Progress Tracker is not another motivational app. It is a tool for building discipline through systematic habit tracking. No gamification. No streaks for the sake of streaks. Just clear data about your commitment to improvement.

## Core Features

### Discipline Score
A single metric (0-100) that measures true consistency based on:
- Daily completion consistency over 30 days
- Weekly completion rate
- Streak stability

### KONIK Mode
Focus mode that hides all future planning and shows only today's tasks. Discipline is built in the present moment.

### Daily Execution Focus
Today's tasks are visually prioritized. The app guides you to execute first, plan second.

### Habit Intention
Attach meaning to your habits with the "Why" field. Build habits with purpose, not just momentum.

### Weekly Reflections
Structured reflection prompts every 7 days:
- What worked?
- What didn't?
- What will you improve?

### Milestone Acknowledgments
Calm, respectful messages at key streaks. No celebration, just acknowledgment.
- "7 days. Most people quit before this."
- "30 days. This is discipline."
- "100 days. Habit is no longer effort."

## Philosophy

KONIK believes discipline is not a feeling. It is a system. This tracker is built on four pillars:

**Consistency** - Show up every day. Small actions compound into transformation.

**Progress** - Measure what matters. Track to improve, not to impress.

**Systems** - Build processes that work. Results follow reliable systems.

**Discipline** - Do what needs doing. Especially when you don't feel like it.

## Make It Happen

This is a tool by KONIK for people who understand that progress comes from consistent action, not motivation.
